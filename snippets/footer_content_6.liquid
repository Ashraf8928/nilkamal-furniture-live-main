<h2><strong>How to Take Care of Your Plastic Chairs? </strong></h2>
<p>

    ><strong><u>plastic chairs</u></strong></a
  >
  are an excellent choice for seating in any indoor or outdoor space. These
  versatile <strong>chairs</strong> are sturdy and durable. However, to ensure
  the <strong>plastic chairs</strong> retain their appeal and functionality for
  a long time, you must take care of them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Here are expert tips to care for your <strong>plastic chairs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Regular Chair Cleaning</strong>- Like other furniture pieces,
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong> accumulate dust and debris. As they are
    sturdier than other materials, dust and debris cannot damage them in the
    short term. However, in the long term, accumulated dust can damage their
    appearance. So, regular <strong>chair cleaning</strong> is required. You can
    clean dust from <strong>plastic chairs</strong> with a soft-bristle brush or
    cloth.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Deep Chair Cleaning</strong>- Dust can be removed from
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong> with a brush. But, you need to do deep
    <strong>chair cleaning</strong> for tough stains or debris in nooks. For
    deep cleaning, use a mild soap and water solution. Use this solution with a
    cloth or sponge and brush to ensure every corner is clean. Gently scrub the
    tough stains and debris without using excessive force. Remember not to use
    hard or harsh chemical and abrasive brushes. Abrasive brushes and harsh
    chemicals can leave scratches and fade the colour. Wash later with clean
    water to rinse off the solution thoroughly. When not cleaned thoroughly, the
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong> can have a soapy film remaining on them.
    Soapy film will act as a glue for dust, making it tougher to clean
    later.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid Pressure Cleaners</strong>- Power washers or high-pressure
    cleaners dispense water with high force. When
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong> are cleaned with high-pressure cleaners,
    they can get damaged due to the excessive force. So, avoid using
    high-pressure cleaners. To wash, use a basic hose or bucket.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Use Chair Cover</strong>- <strong>Plastic chairs</strong> are most
    suitable for outdoor spaces. However, prolonged exposure to direct sunlight
    can harm them. They can lose their structure or colour or become brittle. To
    avoid this, use a <strong>chair cover</strong> for your outdoor
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong>. A <strong>chair cover</strong> will prevent
    direct exposure to UV rays. And your <strong>plastic chairs</strong> will
    retain their appeal and sturdiness for long.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Do Proper Storage</strong>- <strong>Plastic chairs</strong> can be
    left unattended when not in use. This damages their colour and surface. So,
    when not using your <strong>plastic chairs</strong> regularly, store them in
    shaded and closed areas to avoid dust accumulation and exposure to UV rays.
    If no extra space is available for storage, you can also use a
    <strong>chair cover</strong> or plastic cover to keep them away from dust or
    UV rays.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid Excessive Weight</strong>- <strong>Plastic chairs</strong> are
    sturdy and easily withstand high weight. However, excessive weight beyond
    their capacity can bend or crack them. So, avoid putting excessive weight on
    your <strong>plastic chairs</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

    easily moved around, they can also be used in other places. You can move
    <strong>chairs</strong> from the living room to your study, dining space or
    lounge when needed. Similarly, <strong>chairs</strong> from different places
    can be moved to the living space when required.&nbsp;

<h2><strong>Tips to Take Care of Your Outdoor Chairs </strong></h2>

<p>
  Nilkamal Furniture <strong>outdoor chair</strong> collection is made from
  superior material. The outdoor chairs are sturdy and durable. They last for
  several years. Still, you should care for your
  <strong>outdoor chair</strong> to maintain its appeal and functionality.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Here are a few tips to take care of your <strong>outdoor chair</strong>:</p><br>

<h3><strong>Dust Cleaning </strong></h3>
<p>
  The outdoor environment is full of dust and dirt. Atmospheric moisture can
  toughen the dust. Plus, insects and birds can also dirty your outdoor chairs.
  So, your outdoor chairs get dirty and dusty quickly. Accumulated dust can turn
  into debris and damage your outdoor chair's appearance. So, regular
  <strong>chair cleaning</strong> is necessary to maintain the looks and
  structure of your outdoor chairs. For <strong>chair cleaning</strong>, use a
  soft bristle brush or a soft cloth. Please don&rsquo;t use a hard brush as it
  can leave scratches.&nbsp;
</p><br>

<h3><strong>Stain Cleaning </strong></h3>
<p>
  Sometimes accumulated dust can turn into stains, or your outdoor chairs get
  dirty stains due to other things. Stain cannot be cleaned with a brush. You
  need to clean stains with a damp cloth. A damp cloth will clean soft stains
  easily. However, you must use a soap solution or a soft cleaner for tough
  stains. Apply soap solution on the stains and wash thoroughly with clean
  water. Wash your <strong>outdoor chair</strong> with soap instead of
  spot-cleaning stains when it i filthy. Then, wash the chair with clean water
  and dry it with a clean cloth.&nbsp;
</p><br>

<h3><strong>Chair Cover </strong></h3>
<p>
  Use a <strong>chair cover</strong> to protect your outdoor chairs from getting
  dirty. A <strong>chair cover</strong> will protect the chairs from dust, dirt
  and other stains. Also, a <strong>chair cover</strong> is necessary for
  outdoor chairs with cushioned seats. The fabric of cushioned outdoor chairs
  will get dirty with environmental dust and other factors. So, a removal
  <strong>chair cover</strong> will save the cushion material from getting
  dirty. You can periodically wash the <strong>chair cover</strong> and reuse
  it.&nbsp;
</p><br>

<h3><strong>UV Protection </strong></h3>
<p>
  Nilkamal Furniture outdoor chairs are made from quality and sturdy material.
  They are made for withstanding various weather conditions. Still, prolonged
  direct sun exposure can harm them. Therefore, if there is direct sunlight on
  your outdoor chairs, cover them to protect them. You can also store the
  outdoor chairs when you don&rsquo;t use them regularly.&nbsp;
