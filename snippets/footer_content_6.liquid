<h2> <strong>What Factors to Consider While Picking up Chairs? </strong> </h2>
<br>
<p> <strong>Chairs</strong>  are your everyday companion that flexes your muscles as well as comfort. You may need clarification with the plethora of designs, colours and chair types. Always consider the below options to choose your right fit. Here are some thumb rules to make your online chair shopping beneficial. Let's look at the significant parameters to pick the right chair for your house below:&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Seat Height </strong> </h3>
<p>There are low and high-rise chairs in the market. Always decide the seat height before you shop for your favourite  <strong>chair colour</strong> . The rule of thumb is to measure the available space in your  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/living-room">living room</a></u>  or  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/bed-room">bedroom</a></u>  and then decide on the seat height. Some designer chairs need more space, and only an appropriate size can satisfy your need and money. Be careful before choosing the dimensions of your chair. When in doubt, ask professionals to help with the measurements.</p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Theme </strong> </h3>
<p>The overall decor theme should dictate the colour and design of your  <strong>chair</strong> . A lounge chair may not fit into a traditionally designed living room but can look great in a modern-art bedroom. Make sure the chair you select serves the purpose without compromising on the theme. Your chair should coordinate well with the wallpapers, sofa colours, wall paint, and  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/tables">tables</a></u>  to go with the flow without awkwardness. Next time you invite guests to a well-themed living room, they will awe by the eye-catchy decor.</p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Material </strong> </h3>
<p>Chairs are available in fabric, plastic, leatherette and mesh. Check the durability, strength, and washing instructions properly. You can select a lightweight  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/plastic-chairs">plastic chair</a></u>  with a modern outlook for indoor and outdoor seating while fabric/leather chairs in your living and bedroom for a luxurious look. If you prefer maintenance and simplicity over luxury, opt for plastic chairs.</p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Budget </strong> </h3>
<p>Good quality chairs with high-quality craftsmanship are necessary on an affordable budget. Chairs are a necessity, almost in every room of your house. Take a look at different price lists at Nilkamal Furniture and buy the ones you can afford. Trendy and modern designs are available online at pocket-friendly rates. The high-quality chairs provide a long life, saving you money.</p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Comfort </strong> </h3>
<p>Ensure to look for proper armrests, back support, and suitable body posture before selecting a chair. The chair design should support the curve of your body to eliminate any back pain. You can go for ergonomic office chairs with lumbar support that aids long working hours, providing optimum comfort. Always check the comfort level, price, quality and design for a smooth experience.</p>

<h2> <strong>How Can You Select the Best Colour of Chair Best Suited&nbsp; 
 to Your Home Space? </strong> </h2>
<br>
<p>One part of choosing  <strong>furniture </strong> that needs to be clarified is the colour selection.  <strong>Chair colour</strong>  has a significant impact on the feel of your living space. If you want to select a safe option, go for neutral colours. A chocolate  <strong>brown chair</strong>  or  <strong>beige chair</strong>  can work well for your chairs,  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sofa-sets">sofa sets</a></u> , and tables. Choose soft tones like a  <strong>white chair</strong>  or light  <strong>blue chair</strong>  for a spacious and inviting look. Subtle white can work for small rooms. Pair a light-coloured fabric couch with light colours. If you have an open and airy place, choose bright colours like a  <strong>maroon chair</strong> /  <strong>black chair</strong>  for the room interiors. Decorating your home with appropriate  <strong>chair furniture</strong>  can be overwhelming, and Nilkamal offers many options depending on your decor. But remember that  <strong>furniture </strong> colour is personal and can help you hone in on a palette more naturally. Play with hot and bright colours if your room gets enough sunlight. Sun can complement the intensity and amp up the vibrancy. Embrace the darker room with light and moodier hues of chairs.

<h2><strong>How to Take Care of Your Plastic Chairs? </strong></h2>
<p>
  Nilkamal Furniture
  <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/plastic-chairs"
    ><strong><u>plastic chairs</u></strong></a
  >
  are an excellent choice for seating in any indoor or outdoor space. These
  versatile <strong>chairs</strong> are sturdy and durable. However, to ensure
  the <strong>plastic chairs</strong> retain their appeal and functionality for
  a long time, you must take care of them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Here are expert tips to care for your <strong>plastic chairs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Regular Chair Cleaning</strong>- Like other furniture pieces,
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong> accumulate dust and debris. As they are
    sturdier than other materials, dust and debris cannot damage them in the
    short term. However, in the long term, accumulated dust can damage their
    appearance. So, regular <strong>chair cleaning</strong> is required. You can
    clean dust from <strong>plastic chairs</strong> with a soft-bristle brush or
    cloth.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Deep Chair Cleaning</strong>- Dust can be removed from
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong> with a brush. But, you need to do deep
    <strong>chair cleaning</strong> for tough stains or debris in nooks. For
    deep cleaning, use a mild soap and water solution. Use this solution with a
    cloth or sponge and brush to ensure every corner is clean. Gently scrub the
    tough stains and debris without using excessive force. Remember not to use
    hard or harsh chemical and abrasive brushes. Abrasive brushes and harsh
    chemicals can leave scratches and fade the colour. Wash later with clean
    water to rinse off the solution thoroughly. When not cleaned thoroughly, the
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong> can have a soapy film remaining on them.
    Soapy film will act as a glue for dust, making it tougher to clean
    later.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid Pressure Cleaners</strong>- Power washers or high-pressure
    cleaners dispense water with high force. When
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong> are cleaned with high-pressure cleaners,
    they can get damaged due to the excessive force. So, avoid using
    high-pressure cleaners. To wash, use a basic hose or bucket.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Use Chair Cover</strong>- <strong>Plastic chairs</strong> are most
    suitable for outdoor spaces. However, prolonged exposure to direct sunlight
    can harm them. They can lose their structure or colour or become brittle. To
    avoid this, use a <strong>chair cover</strong> for your outdoor
    <strong>plastic chairs</strong>. A <strong>chair cover</strong> will prevent
    direct exposure to UV rays. And your <strong>plastic chairs</strong> will
    retain their appeal and sturdiness for long.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Do Proper Storage</strong>- <strong>Plastic chairs</strong> can be
    left unattended when not in use. This damages their colour and surface. So,
    when not using your <strong>plastic chairs</strong> regularly, store them in
    shaded and closed areas to avoid dust accumulation and exposure to UV rays.
    If no extra space is available for storage, you can also use a
    <strong>chair cover</strong> or plastic cover to keep them away from dust or
    UV rays.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid Excessive Weight</strong>- <strong>Plastic chairs</strong> are
    sturdy and easily withstand high weight. However, excessive weight beyond
    their capacity can bend or crack them. So, avoid putting excessive weight on
    your <strong>plastic chairs</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

    to move around for rearrangement or creating space. You can move
    <strong>chairs</strong> to give your living room

    needed, you can move them to another place. The ease of moving
    <strong>chairs</strong> makes them more preferable to sofas.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>
    <strong>Easy Accessibility</strong>- <strong>Chairs</strong> are easy to
    access for people of all ages. Even kids and the elderly can easily sit on a
    chair securely. The sturdy back and armrest provide ample support for the
    elderly to get up or sit down.&nbsp;

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Versatile Functionality</strong>- As <strong>chairs</strong> can be
    easily moved around, they can also be used in other places. You can move
    <strong>chairs</strong> from the living room to your study, dining space or
    lounge when needed. Similarly, <strong>chairs</strong> from different places
    can be moved to the living space when required.&nbsp;

  Your television is no longer the idiot box it was earlier fondly known as.

  shows. Plus, you have a horde of gadgets to amplify your entertainment
  experience. You need a <strong>TV cabinet</strong> to organise and ensure your
  entertainment experience is seamless. A <strong>TV showcase</strong> is the
  perfect entertainment unit to collect and display all your entertainment
  gadgets.
</p>

<p>
  Along with being a place to house your TV and other gadgets, a
  <strong>modern TV stand</strong> is also a decorative furniture piece,
  uplifting your home aesthetics.

  <strong>TV cabinet</strong> designs in various styles and sizes. You can

<br>
<p> <strong>TV units</strong>  are the most noticeable furnishings perceived when one enters a home.

The unit's colour, finishing touch, petit or large size, the material used, and stored items are some features noticed at first glance. A spacious unit with multiple shelves adds a magnifying look to the living room. Whilst a puny-sized unit with minimum storage capacity, shelves and cabinets immediately imbibes a limited vibe to the surrounding.

<br>
<h2> <strong>What Makes Chic Entertainment Unit furniture for the Home? </strong> </h2>
<p>Regardless of the type of living room, whether modern or conventional, a stylish TV unit can perk up the living room.  <strong>TV units</strong>  have become integral to the home since television sets were introduced. Whether a standing TV set or a wall-mountable one, the type of television unit makes a big difference to the living room. Since the  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/living-room">living room</a></u>  is the most central part of the home, visitors are often welcomed there. A few pointers to keep in mind before investing in a television unit are listed below.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Television Size </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The TV unit size must be considered when selecting the TV showcase. A suitable unit is one that easily accommodates the television as well as some other display items. Photograph frames, souvenirs, decorative items, cutlery, etc., can then be conveniently displayed on such units as a part of the living room d&eacute;cor.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Television Screen Size </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The television set's exact screen size must be measured before choosing the  <strong>entertainment unit online</strong> . The screen must be easily seen from the  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sofa-sets">sofa set</a></u>  in the living room, and a slightly larger TV screen space must be considered for an easy view of the screen.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Height of the Unit </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A suitable height in the television staging unit is to be chosen before selecting as this maintains an ideal angle for easy viewing. This is needed for an uninterrupted TV viewing experience.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Matching Living Room Furniture </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The other furniture in the living room must be kept in mind when choosing the TV unit. A similar material and finishing touch, when maintained, gives uniformity to the home, enhancing the homely concept for a lasting impression.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Living Room Space </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The space within the living room, whether small or large, must be considered before getting the TV unit. The structure of the living room impacts the design of the television showcase too. One cannot place a big showcase in a tiny apartment with limited space in the living room. Similarly, a puny showcase in a large and spacious room will make the place look like something is amiss.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Matching Colour Combination </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The colour of the TV showcase, when chosen in a matching colour concept to the rest of the furniture, brings about an even blend in the room. Since the centre of attraction in the living room is the showcase, it cannot be an odd piece of furniture in a completely different concept from the other furniture items.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Knowing how much to spend on the TV showcase can simplify the search process immensely. Pocket-friendly deals are available online that you may choose after knowing the dimensions and materials required.</p>

<h2><strong>Tips to Take Care of Your Outdoor Chairs </strong></h2>

<p>
  Nilkamal Furniture <strong>outdoor chair</strong> collection is made from
  superior material. The outdoor chairs are sturdy and durable. They last for
  several years. Still, you should care for your
  <strong>outdoor chair</strong> to maintain its appeal and functionality.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Here are a few tips to take care of your <strong>outdoor chair</strong>:</p><br>

<h3><strong>Dust Cleaning </strong></h3>
<p>
  The outdoor environment is full of dust and dirt. Atmospheric moisture can
  toughen the dust. Plus, insects and birds can also dirty your outdoor chairs.
  So, your outdoor chairs get dirty and dusty quickly. Accumulated dust can turn
  into debris and damage your outdoor chair's appearance. So, regular
  <strong>chair cleaning</strong> is necessary to maintain the looks and
  structure of your outdoor chairs. For <strong>chair cleaning</strong>, use a
  soft bristle brush or a soft cloth. Please don&rsquo;t use a hard brush as it
  can leave scratches.&nbsp;
</p><br>

<h3><strong>Stain Cleaning </strong></h3>
<p>
  Sometimes accumulated dust can turn into stains, or your outdoor chairs get
  dirty stains due to other things. Stain cannot be cleaned with a brush. You
  need to clean stains with a damp cloth. A damp cloth will clean soft stains
  easily. However, you must use a soap solution or a soft cleaner for tough
  stains. Apply soap solution on the stains and wash thoroughly with clean
  water. Wash your <strong>outdoor chair</strong> with soap instead of
  spot-cleaning stains when it i filthy. Then, wash the chair with clean water
  and dry it with a clean cloth.&nbsp;
</p><br>

<h3><strong>Chair Cover </strong></h3>
<p>
  Use a <strong>chair cover</strong> to protect your outdoor chairs from getting
  dirty. A <strong>chair cover</strong> will protect the chairs from dust, dirt
  and other stains. Also, a <strong>chair cover</strong> is necessary for
  outdoor chairs with cushioned seats. The fabric of cushioned outdoor chairs
  will get dirty with environmental dust and other factors. So, a removal
  <strong>chair cover</strong> will save the cushion material from getting
  dirty. You can periodically wash the <strong>chair cover</strong> and reuse
  it.&nbsp;
